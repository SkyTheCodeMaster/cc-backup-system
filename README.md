Simple http backup system

This utilizes an ender modem combined with [Redrun](https://gist.github.com/MCJack123/473475f07b980d57dd2bd818026c97e8) to run a small program in the background of a running computer to listen and respond to modem messages to automatically upload it's filesystem to a cloud storage server.
